# Maven Toyes Profit Margin Project
***This data analysis project aims to improve the profit margin of the company Maven Toys using the co products, sales, stores, and inventory data.***

**Question:** The executive at Maven Toys is interested in how they can strategically improve their margins. 

**Reframing the Question:** Analyzing the data, which products should Maven Toys focus on while utilizing what methods to improve overall sales margin. Which products are of interest company wide and which products are of interest at individual stores.

**Executive Summary:** This project provides an analysis and strategic recommendations for improving sales margins at Maven Toys by analyzing company wide and individual store data to identify specific products that can improve sales margin and by association sales revenue. The project will also identify products that hinder sales margin through analysis of low sales revenue and products with long shelf lifes. The method of our analysis consists of calculating average cost, generated sale revenue, product margin, variable correlation and age of inventory.

**The recommendations are as follows:**
1. Reduce the cost of goods for top selling products through strategic ordering and bulk purchasing.
2. Implement strategic offerings on products during periods of low revenue generation.
3. Encouraging sales of high margin products through product prominence in low performing locations.
4. Evaluating inventory data to identify margin reducing products.
5. Methods that should not be implemented because they reduce margin; against intuition
